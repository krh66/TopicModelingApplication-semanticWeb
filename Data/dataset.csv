1,,1,2015-01-27T21:23:05.507,Should we describe the process of brewing a single cup via pouring water over ground coffee as pour-over-coffee or drip-coffee?,"While answering a few of EdChum's questions I discovered that what I/we in the USA call pour over coffee is referred to as drip coffee in the UK. I added the pour-over tag to both questions I encountered but figured we should decide as a community which tag to use to describe this brewing process and then properly document it because drip-coffee means something different in the US (which is apparently referred to as filter-cofee in the UK). For clarification the method in question is shown in the image below.

"
18,16,2,2015-01-28T01:30:33.230,,"What flavor is ""preferable"", strikes me as primarily opinion based. However, asking about the general types of coffee flavors should be encouraged. When describing a flavor or taste there are going to be some adjectives that may not be viewed the same way by everyone reading them. If one person says a coffee is ""bitter"", that's not necessarily opinion based. Saying that ""because it's bitter it is no good"", however, is.
It's hard to mark a defining line, but it's a line that we can define as a community, and shouldn't try to pin down right away (though, for the most part, I think it will be fairly obvious when someone crosses it).
Other examples:
Opinion based

A robusta is better than an arabica
Do you prefer a french press or a pour-over?
Bitter coffee's taste bad

Not opinion based

This coffee has a bitter aftertaste
Coffee A is more bitter than coffee B (somewhat opinion based, but how else do you describe it when making a comparison? this really depends on the question, I think)

At least one person suggested that this second part of the question (about what mechanisms cause flavor differences if altitude does indeed affect the final product) was ""too scientific"" and suggested that it be closed.

Questions about the biology of a coffee bean probably belong elsewhere (as they are more about biology and could probably apply to any bean), questions about how some chemical process affects the final flavor of coffee, probably belong here (as it's something a coffee expert could probably answer better than a general chemistry expert).

If we then call the machine method filter-coffee, and discourage the use of drip-coffee, it makes for less ambiguity. Admittedly, it does make it difficult for the nationalities who don't use those terms, but I think that's better than having half the people on here tagging with one and half the other.

Asking for an honest product recommendation doesn't make for a bad question; asking in a manner that invites dozens of answers due to a lack of scope and constraint makes for a bad question. There are only a limited number of double-walled glass presses in a 2 cup size, and I'd be quite put off if I came to a site all about coffee and couldn't ask which one was also likely to hold up in a dishwasher. 
Questions that don't limit the potential number of answers that could be received are by nature too broad, and you have a close reason for those available to you. I'd wait, see if these actually become a problem, and enjoy giving thorough answers to the more interesting ones while you do. It's fine to have a zero-tolerance spam policy as many of our other sites have adopted, and an inclination to burn link-only or astroturf-like answers as you see them.
But don't stop yourself from recommending a brand if you're happy with that brand. I love Breville's products and I recommended one of their grinders to someone earlier today, in the course of writing a thorough answer. And if spammers start writing comprehensive, thorough answers that receive up-votes then we can basically say mission accomplished.

Are many of their answers that also mention their product only tangentially related to the question at hand? That can spell trouble, if someone is looking for places to plant stuff
Do they clearly mention that it's their link? That's important, as it asserts a sort of ""I hereby assert that this is given in good faith in the spirit of being helpful"" thing

We positively want people whose job is coffee on this site, those are your professionals, the people that do lots of science and can answer tougher questions, especially about the brewing process. If they support some of their answers with stuff they're affiliated with, that's great. If they go a bit too overboard, moderators have means of contacting them to let them know.
With that said...
Coffee is a topic that is ripe with products (no pun intended), and we will see our fair share of folks that have come here for the wrong reasons. Fortunately, most of us have a very good ability to determine when something just doesn't seem right - and we give you the ability to flag things for moderator attention.
If you see something that gives you a bit of pause, and you seriously wonder if the person is here for the wrong reasons, flag it as 'other' and let us / the moderators-to-be have a look at it. Blatant spam obviously deserves a spam flag directly, I'm talking about the ""If it weren't for the other answers in their history linking to the same site, this would seem completely benign"" sorts of things.

If a question can be made clearer by providing more context, you can easily ask the author for clarification in a comment. With a bit of thoughtful guidance, you create a pleasant end-user experience for all. But when every other question is rubber stamped with ""What have you tried?"", it can start to look a bit forced and unnecessary, and even a bit harassing.

Moka is what some call a stovetop espresso maker, which I think is a misnomer anyway.  But it uses pressure to force water through grounds.  Water goes through the grounds (which are in the middle of the device) once into a storage vessel on top, which is separate from the chamber in which the water was added at the beginning of the brew.
But I call percolator something that boils water and drips it over grounds repeatedly.  There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is repeatedly boiled and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber).  The brewed coffee ends up where the plain water was at the beginning of the brew.
I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso. Though similar in concept, they're (to me) totally different in outcome.

Meta sites do not have an edit queue, and so the ""edit"" link is not active for (other users') questions and answers on [meta] for those with less than some threshold rep (1k or 2k depending on the site).  The only reason seems to be that it isn't necessary and/or it's harmful to add another queue for mods.
The help section says that any user should be able to suggest edits, which is true on the [main] site.  But because there's no suggested-edit queue it seems that the edit ability on [meta] only for higher-rep users (1000+; 2000+ on ""mature"" sites), which is the trusted-user rep threshold at which point you can make edits directly (without going into a suggestion-queue). I suppose this means that at 1k rep you can also edit meta directly, but it's a little awkward to suggest stuff that ought to be changed ""out of band"".  This discourages editing on [meta], which may be a fine thing, but I think it also reduces participation, which is probably not a good thing.

79,52,2,2015-02-11T20:51:16.203,,"I maintain that original research should be permitted; coffee is a mix of science and art:

substantiating references should be provided (and expected) for factually verifiable data: e.g., scientific facts; and
""original research"" or experiential recounting should be permissible for the ""artful"" aspects of coffee; e.g., techniques.

Hopefully expanding on @hardmath's answer, I believe that community input and verification is the mechanism to ensure a high quality of information, no matter what its source. I think there are three issues here: fact, art, and opinion.
If something is a verifiable fact: e.g., 

Kirk never said ""Beam me up, Scotty!"" (refs from here)
Han Solo did say ""I'm in it for the money.""

These facts can be (and indeed should be) backed up by a reference. If they're not there, they can be (and should be) added. If they're false, a countering reference can be provided, and/or the statement gets downvoted, deleted, edited, etc. 
Art-, experience-, or technique-based questions and answers are legitimate; for example:

speculation, such as about diner coffee taste
actual literal art or technique of latte foam
experiential or traditional factors in serving and drinking coffee, like wide serving cups.

These happen to also be high-rating (10+ as of this writing), popular questions; but that doesn't itself make them legitimate. In some cases, these can (and should) be backed up with citations or references.  Are those examples of non-fact, and are they legitimate?

While the second could lose it easily enough (maybe flavorings would be nicer?), what about the first? ground doesn't feel quite right, but neither does having 'coffee' in the tag.

Should the word coffee be removed/banned from all tag names?

If you do want to remove it from tags, I might suggest replacing the existing ones with grinding and flavoring.

I understand what you're saying, but your last two sentences lost me. I suggested an edit that might clarify what you're trying to express without changing the intent of your post

The person can then just review the edit, and apply it or change it slightly if they agree. On meta, where it's much more about voice, that's pretty ideal. Unfortunately the way you've proposed it is just not technically feasible. I'll go into why.
The voices, man, I keep hearing 'em!
Every suggested edit generates an inbox notification. On sites like Ask Ubuntu, Ask Different, Stack Overflow and others where meta sees significantly more participation than other sites, this would create a lot of noise. The alternative is not generating inbox notifications for child meta suggested edits, which (unfortunately, for the most part) means they'd go unseen or approved in a queue by others, and might not be something the author would have approved as suggested. Meta is a town hall; that's why you need privileges to edit directly on the main site to edit here, one of the chief reasons anyway.
Killed by slow, and do you even meta?
On sites that don't have very active child meta sites, participation is much lower. Turning on work queues here would just mean creating a backlog that moderators would feel obliged to clean out from time to time. It just wouldn't work as you intend it to work. Showing them in the main site queue alleviates that to some extent, but that's shown to everyone regardless of meta participation. Queues where you accomplish small units of work are already a big ask on the main site, I really don't want to mix them. As meta sites tend to take on their own culture over time, I don't want non-participants here reviewing suggested edits because the system asked them to.
I am a mean, horrible person.
But with all of that said, turning our engine sort of upside down for discussion here on meta worked well enough. But, it's missing stuff. There aren't any polls, people can get down-voted for asking for support, curating is sort of second class and opportunistic and using it as a bug tracker could be made much more ideal.
I hope to take on a project this year that takes a serious look at child meta sites, and how they could perhaps diverge a bit in terms of features from the main sites. This is something I'd like to see possible, just ... better, not bolted on.
I'm declining it as proposed, but that doesn't make it a bad idea. In fact it's a good one (heck, I up-voted it), but in need of some groundwork that I really want to do.

Not every question about coffee is on topic for a Stack site about coffee: Stacks want to be neatly-sorted piles of questions and answers wherein experts solve actual problems that people are facing. The Stack Exchange has little interest in duplicating services other parts of the Internet are already good at providing, and is structured so that often those services just plain don't work here. This is why we are choosey about the questions we get.
Lets turn to the Help Center and see what it has to say about how question structure helps accomplish Stack goals.
The Help Center lists some flags indicating that a question might be a poor fit for the site. If a potential question hits more than one of the flags, that's a sign it's likely not gonna work out here.

To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, avoid asking subjective questions where …

every answer is equally valid
there is no actual problem to be solved

(source)

A list of coffees would make every answer equally valid, and there's no actual problem being solved. That breaks our voting system, making it impossible for our answers to be neatly sorted by the groupmind.
Now lets look at signs of a good question:


Have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your question?
if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful answer.

(source)

The second bullet point there reinforces the idea that questions should have problems they're trying to solve: without a particular situation the querent faces, details and context for useful answers are impossible.
And the first bullet point really hits the thing on the nose: the Stack is a place to ask experts to leverage their education and experience in a field to solve problems we can't solve ourselves. The Stack is not a place to ask experts to do simple research for us.
For further reading, I suggest Repositories; Polling, Recommendations and subjective-ish stuff; Questions with educational value; Is trivia on topic?; and What's so problematic about a recommendation question having potentially hundreds of answers, anyway?.

Your example ""What are different sources of caffeine?"" is a bad question for SE in general, as it's kinda open ended and the answer would just be a big list. Even questions like ""What plants produce caffeine?"" might do better on Gardening.SE.

The tour sums it in the first sentence:

Coffee Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for people interested in all aspects of producing and consuming coffee. 

That's it.  If your question doesn't involve producing or consuming coffee, it's questionable.  Though coffee (does, generally) happen to contain caffeine, caffeine (itself) is not the topic of the site. Some other examples: Cola is off-topic, even though the beverage has a similar color. Tea is off-topic (see also original discussion), even though it has other similarities. Questions that discuss coffee, and happen to mention other topics (e.g., tea or cola) are fine -- if they discuss coffee as their primary topic.
That said, we do need to put some content at the help/on-topic page.  This is the canonical location for detailed information about what is on-topic at a given site; it's shortcut-linkable in comments from [help/on-topic].

If you do not award the bounty within 24 hours of the bounty period ending, half the bounty value will be automatically awarded to the top voted answer posted after the bounty start, provided it has a score of at least 2. If no new answer matches this requirement, no reputation will be awarded at all, and the reputation used on the bounty will be lost forever.

Please notice this part for specificly:

If you do not award the bounty within 24 hours of the bounty period ending, half the bounty value will be automatically awarded to the top voted answer posted after the bounty start, provided it has a score of at least 2.

I have the current highest voted answer with a score of +8 yet I didn't get any of the rep (75 to be exact). The half-bounty was actually awarded to therewillbecoffee's answer instead.

1119,,1,2015-02-20T02:07:25.220,How Should A Coffee Moderator Introduce A New User,"I personally think that moderators should have a fun way to introducing our new users to Coffee.SE. Seriously, it is getting old with this similar phrase:

Welcome to Coffee.SE! Please remember to take the tour and earn your next badge of honor! Please take a quick visit to the Help Center to help improve the quality of future your posts.

Lots of mods use a similar phrase to introduce new users on whatever SE site they are on 
(Sam Whited, you know what I mean :-) ). It starts to get old, then boring, and finally just plain annoying. New users should receive a warm, meaningful welcome, not a robotic-like message implied to every new user. My question is, how should the Coffee Mods introduce our new users in a warm, friendly way without using the same message again and again? All suggestions are appreciated and don't be afraid to share your idea?
"
1120,1119,2,2015-02-20T02:27:11.800,,"First off, a defense of messages like that one. Keep in mind that the welcome isn't for us, it's for the new user. Even if the same welcome message has been posted plenty of times and you're tired of it, it's the first time they've seen it - that's why they're being welcomed! So it doesn't seem nearly so robotic to them as to you.
Also, while making them feel welcomed is half the goal, letting them know about the ground rules is really important too. A lot of people expect discussion forums, and are really confused by the way StackExchange sites work the first time they visit. They post not-really-answers, they take downvotes personally, and so on. Pointing them to the tour/help at the first opportunity is an attempt to avoid this.
So in my mind, the canned messages are fine. I might tweak the one you quoted a bit, but there's nothing wrong with something along those lines. If I wanted to go beyond that, I'd simply to throw in a specific comment as well - something very simple that I liked about their post, or a suggestion for improving it. But that's not always too easy, and I don't think there's anything wrong with just using the template.

That said, if you want more variety, why not just welcome them yourself?
The moderators don't own the site. Their primary job is to do the things that no one else can. This early in a beta, there's a little more in that category since there are fewer high-reputation users. But welcoming a new user? All you need to be able to do is comment.
So if you want to contribute some variety, go for it. A variety of users doing the welcoming is perhaps even more meaningful than a variety of messages: it demonstrates that the site is a community site, not one kept carefully under the control of a few moderators. Just keep in mind why you're doing it: to make them feel welcome, yes, but also to help them learn how the site works so they can make good contributions.

The original (see the history) was specifically about one brand; it received several close-votes for ""opinion-based"" reason.
I edited the question in an attempt to make it ""more objective"" -- e.g., what affects coffee's stimulation? I provided an answer about the tangible aspects of caffeine, which turned out to be more of a survey, predominantly with links to other questions about factors that affect caffeine content in coffee.  The question was closed, but it has now received re-open votes, so it looks like we have disagreement (at least in part, a good thing)!
Such ""survey"" questions and answers are not always on-topic, and are often controversial (another example is this question of mine from Stack Overflow, in which I summarized a handful of other questions). That question was closed and subsequently re-opened, meaning that it probably received several close- and open-votes.
I happen to (personally) appreciate those kind of question/answer when appropriate; I value them as an index and summary of several questions, often comparisons of (or distinguishing between) questions within a certain tag.
To the extent that this represents an example of a ""survey of other questions"" answer: Are such ""survey"" answers (and the related question) reasonable? Or should such questions be discouraged, and limit to more narrow, on-point questions about a similar topic?

That said, I can see problems with opening the door to all ""summary-like"" questions, many of which may instead belong as wikis or just good chat discussions. Instead I think we just need to weigh each question as it comes in. Maybe eventually we'll have a list specifically for coffee.se to show which borderline questions survive and which don't.

Joel had an early blog post about this.
At Math.SE we might treat these as ""abstract duplicates"", and a list of them, List of Generalizations of Common Questions is maintained on meta.  
For example, we get a lot of posts asking things very similar to: why is 1+2+3+... = -1/12?  (It makes a little more sense than one might suspect at first glance.)  Rather than run through the basics each time, it was thought expedient to have one well-answered post of this kind and then be able to refer new Questions to that one as an ""abstract duplicate"".
Something of the kind seems to be in the spirit of ""summary-like"" questions.  Although it is early days, we might see such repetitive trends emerging.  If so, I'd recommend keeping track of those with a meta thread, so that finding those ""canonical"" answers can be easy enough (and it would admit some discussion on meta whether a topic deserves ""summary"" treatment).

Let's focus instead about what you're really asking, and what type of answer you're looking for. It seems that there's quite a bit of interest in the topic of Kopi Luwak, because there are several questions about it and much discussion. I think there's a lot of room for interesting Q&A related to this topic!
Fundamentally, what's your question or what are you trying to solve? From your initial question, it sounds like...

you have never tried Kopi Luwak;
you don't know how it tastes,
you are unable or unwilling to try it;
you are looking for an alternative.

Are any of those a more fundamental question that you have?  How about changing the question to, ""What does Kopi Luwak taste like?"" Then you can also ask in the body of the question, or infer from the answer, ""What other coffees taste like it?""  Though similar in concept, I think ""how does it taste"" comes across better.  What do you think? I'd be happy to re-articulate the question with you, or un-lock it if you change it around.  For example:

What does Kopi Luwak taste like?
I have never had the opportunity to try Kopi Luwak, but I'd like to know how it tastes. How is does the taste differ from more traditionally processed coffee from the same region? Are there other coffees that have similar tasting notes?

Or something like that. That said, this answer says Kopi Luwak is delicious, and has some descriptions, but there's probably room for another question on the topic.
Another question might be something more like ""Why does Kopi Luwak taste different?"" For example, what is it about the Kopi Luwak digestion process that changes the beans? What happens to the beans during digestion (e.g., protein digestion)?
There might also be room for a question about Black Ivory Coffee, which is apparently coffee digestively ""processed"" in a similar way by rescued elephants.

For example, we can't just lump all 'espresso' questions together and discourage questions which want to know the specifics on one machine/brand. An entry level £50 espresso machine is a whole different ball game to one costing £1000+, and believe me people who are into their coffee will drop that kind of money easily, and will want answers on their specific set up.
This is just my opinion, but I have been put off asking questions I've had because they're very much related to my machine and grinder set up. I think more questions on specific machines would get more search engine hits and therefore grow the site quicker.

My goal there was to clear up some terms that I didn't understand and that were being used somewhat inconsistently or imprecisely.

Another take on this is that some questions that are on-topic for the site might be already answered well other places.

Each week, the highest-voted suggestion becomes the weekly topic challenge. A meta post is written up giving a brief summary of the
  idea (with the featured tag, hopefully), and at the end of the week,
  users who asked or answered one or more questions about that topic are
  recognized.
Repeat until everyone gets tired of the idea or everyone runs out of suggestions.


Should we have these challenges, how often should we have them, and who should be in charge of them?

1146,,1,2015-06-01T20:18:25.330,Why was this question migrated without discussion?,"I recently asked this question about how to know what type of coffee to use in a recipe, and how to be able to tell whether the difference will be tasted in the final result. I happened to give a specific recipe example because I was concerned that the question would be too broad without it.
I read Should questions about recipes involving coffee be considered off topic? before posting my answer and I was satisfied that my question was on-topic.
Notably:


Coffee is a common ingredient in many popular deserts, and fits well here, as long as the 'gist' requires knowledge of not just cooking, but also coffee in order to answer.

If a question is on-topic on multiple sites, SE guidelines are that it can be posted on any of them. A question should only be migrated if it is definitely off-topic on the site it is on.

However, my question got migrated to Seasoned Advice. Why? Was it because I provided a specific recipe instead of asking for a general approach? In my opinion my question could have been asked on either site, but I posted it here because I specifically wanted coffee expertise about how to prepare the coffee to use in the recipe, and how to determine what type to use. I know a fair bit about cooking, but I know very little about coffee. Is there any way I could have worded my quesion better to keep it on topic?
Most importantly, why didn't I get a chance to edit it into shape before wham bam migration modhammer?
"
1147,1146,2,2015-06-10T02:08:12.183,,"I wasn't the one who migrated it, so I can't really give an authoritative answer. I do think an explanatory comment would've been helpful, for sure. I also think the question is a better fit for cooking, but perhaps it'd have been best to do nothing; usually we don't migrate questions that seem to be on the boundary between site scopes, and this question is definitely on the boundary.
The rest of the answer discusses why I think it's a better fit on cooking, but do keep in mind I think it'd have been fine not to migrate too!

The key point in my mind is also made in the other meta question you linked to:

If it's more about cooking components, or cooking technique, then it's probably one for Seasoned Advice.

You say you wanted coffee expertise. But the question is about using coffee in a recipe, i.e. in the context of cooking. You're asking about one ingredient as part of a whole, about the combination of non-coffee flavors with other ingredients. People who are experts in making coffee are not necessarily experts in all of that, but people who are experts in cooking will know about how to use all kinds of ingredients, including coffee. It seems like a question that, despite your initial guess, is more about cooking than it is about coffee.
So I'm not sure exactly how you'd shape it up to make it more clearly seek coffee expertise. Coffee expertise will get you great answers about how much the flavor of different kinds of coffee differs, but not much about how obvious that'll be in the context of a tiramisu recipe. What were you trying to ask that cooking folks can't tell you?
Moreover, I'm not sure I'd make it a goal to keep it on coffee; it's not like it suffered because of the migration. When you're asking a question, the goal isn't to make sure it's on a particular site, it's just to get the best answers possible. I missed this when it showed up on cooking, but I think most likely the reason this didn't get any answers beyond the one that was migrated with it is that it's a pretty general question with a general answer, so it's hard to really give a more specific expert answer.  (If it hadn't had that answer, you would doubtless have quickly gotten an answer on cooking, and been just as satisfied.) Nonetheless, I've added a few more thoughts!
Finally, to emphasize, I think it'd have been reasonable to err on the side of doing nothing,  leave here, since you posted it here.

It was posted and had zero votes, zero answers, and zero other comments when I suggested that it get migrated over to here at Coffee. I got push-back from my comments and ended up chatting with her (SA mod) in Chat. Her perspective was very by-the-book (i.e., the aforementioned meta) that says 

We only migrate questions because they are off-topic on the original site. It is perfectly possible for a question to be on-topic on multiple sites, but that is not a reason to migrate it elsewhere. As a general rule, if someone asks a question here, and it's on-topic here, it should stay here.""

(My emphasis added). I was hoping, due to context, that they'd be willing to migrate this very on-point Coffee question to Coffee.SE -- nope. I disagree in this particular case, but she's a mod there and I'll respect her adherence to policy and conviction!
That said, migration should be ""uncommon"". To OP's point, I think the question in question should remain here. The Coffeemaker question, I think, should have been migrated here. This may sound relativist, but we're young and can use on-point questions such as that.
My opinion: If you, as an OP...

are posting a question that is on-topic at multiple sites, and
are aware of both sites, and 
choose to post it at site A instead of other sites (as @starsplusplus did in this case),

then I maintain that it should not be migrated. If any of these assumptions are missing (e.g., OP likely doesn't know about other more-on-topic site) then it's up for discussion.

1155,,1,2015-08-08T02:08:27.550,How can we get people to ask Coffee Questions at This Site?,"I peruse both Coffee and Seasoned Advice daily. Even since the inception of the Coffee site, I frequently see coffee questions on Seasoned Advice. Coffee is on-topic at Seasoned Advice, but it's MORE on-topic here!
I assume this is because users (new and ""seasoned"") simply don't know there's a dedicated Coffee site! Every time I see a coffee question on Seasoned Advice I comment on it (and sometimes answer) to encourage people to join us over here at Coffee. Some recent ones... this one from today, and this one from a few days ago that got supercollided and got an inordinate number of views... and another that spurred this answer to a related MetaCoffee question. All would have been very welcome over here at Coffee! :)
Clearly, we're not going to migrate previous SA questions about Coffee. I also understand not wanting to immediately migrate new questions because of this ""policy"" (which I view more as a suggestion); i.e., don't migrate a coffee question, because Coffee is on-topic at SA.
I think this is significantly impacting Coffee.SE's adoption and relevance. If we had all of the New Coffee Questions over here at Coffee, I think we'd have a much better chance of getting off the ground.
How do we get people to ask Coffee Questions here instead?
"
1156,1155,2,2015-08-10T15:39:26.027,,"Why limit the hunt to Seasoned Advice? 
Sure, they get coffee questions, and that's why you've got a community promotion ad up there. But what if we try thinking beyond ""where are the coffee questions and how do we get them here?"", and instead, think: ""where are the coffee people and how do we get them here?"". 
What kind of people are coffee Q&A people? Millions of people drink coffee, but what we're looking for here is coffee hobbyists, not just drinkers. People who like to experiment with brewing methods, spend money on gear, and optimize for various qualities. They aren't just coffee drinkers - they're coffee tinkerers. So people who might be drawn to this site are tinkerers in other fields who dabble in coffee (among many other likely hobbies). 
Some initial thoughts about where these kinds of people might come from:

Bicycles
Beer
Homebrewing
Lifehacks
The Great Outdoors

There are probably way more. Not all of those sites are graduated, so you won't necessarily be able to place community promotion ads, but it might be a place to start if some Coffee SE ambassadors try to make new friends in those chat rooms and see if they've got any coffee questions.
The upshot of this type of activity is that you aren't trying to take existing people or questions from a site that already welcomes them; you're just trying to show people who might be interested in coffee tinkering that there's a place where their questions would be welcome.
My advice, in the general, tl;dr sense, would be to think about what other types of people would be likely to hang out and ask questions here (the hard part), and then figure out where to go to reach those people (the easy part). 
"
1157,1155,2,2015-08-10T16:08:10.803,,"I think you may be looking at this from the wrong angle. The purpose of creating this site wasn't to start moving a community (or their questions) from one site to another. You're supposed to be out there on the Internet to find a new community (or at least a new scope of questions) that were not being well served before. 
Where is this untapped audience? Or questions that cannot be asked elsewhere? Finding them is your job now.
If you read my article about why (sometimes) we split off subjects from existing sites — Apparently this is a duplicate — I list a few of the criteria we would be looking for:

We would be looking for things like:

An ecosystem of questions that are not already in scope on the existing site(s)
A show of numbers that clearly demonstrates the parent site is failing to attract that
  audience ← this is a big one
A weighty argument that a new community exists that does not identify themselves as part of the larger subject (see Ubuntu versus Unix)
Scope Failure — Maybe we got it wrong the first time. A large subject can cover a huge number of topics. But if the site is not competitive in any particular subject, it may be time for a breakup (""sum of the parts"")
etc.


I think (1) is a tough sell. I haven't seen many of those ""largely off-topic for a cooking site"" questions yet. 
Secondly, if you're trying to divert users/questions from another SE site, that disproves (2) by definition. That would have ended the creation of this site before it even got started. 
That leaves (3) and (4) — a community that loves their coffee, but it would never occur to them to try our Cooking site. 
But I don't believe soliciting and diverting users from other SE sites is the way to go. The best way to bring in that new audience is to find OTHER coffee communities and show them what Stack Exchange is about.
That's why we created this site.

1159,1158,2,2015-08-25T03:15:49.507,,"Two cents from cooking, since our past polls were in a very similar department to your potential ones. The polls may well work out for some amount of time right now - as you say, the site's smaller. But in the long run I'd predict you'll find yourself gradually changing your mind and starting to close them. Old polls still attract new answers. Old polls get used as examples to justify new broad/subjective questions. And new ones get less and less manageable.
Math.SE probably isn't really a great example in favor of this idea; if you look through their big-list tag, you'll find plenty where the voting/sorting has broken down because there are just too many answers, and the early popular ones win out. You'll also find a decent number that are on hold/closed. From what I can tell, the ones that are working out are the ones that aren't actually terribly big lists.
So... it's certainly something you can do, and it's possible it'd attract some users. But if the site keeps growing, you'll almost inevitably find that you have to do a good amount of work to revise your policies and clean up later. Maybe that's a tradeoff worth making, but it's also not a bad idea to try to find other ways to broaden your scope that aren't polls. Maybe you can make product reviews work, or even narrowly scoped recommendations.

Otherwise I fear that in short order we'd risk overtaxing the tag system for organizing dozens or hundred of different Mr. Coffee's.

Your question is basically ""can I use a different descaler product in this machine"" -- right? Questions about coffee equipment and questions about cleaning are certainly on-topic, so it's totally reasonable.
See also, for example, questions tagged equipment and especially this one about descaling espresso machines but your question is certainly different enough to warrant asking.
I hope it's well-received. Some thoughts just for completeness:

Necessary to mention your old machine? Just say you have some other leftover Gaggia brand descaler.
Do you know the ingredients list of either descaler?
Is your question simply ""can I use the Gaggia stuff in the Sage machine?"" Just another way to ask a similar question.

I hope the answer is ""descalers are descalers"" but analogs like ""can I use off-brand ink in this inkjet printer"" hopefully don't hold here.

The conditions for earning certain hats are ""public"" -- well-known to all; other hats are ""secret"" -- you need to figure out what to do to earn the hat. Some public hats might be... ask a well-received question, improve a question, submit an accepted edit, perform tasks in the review queue, etc. Some non-public hats in the past have been... contribute on a particular day, upvote and comment/improve on a first-question from a new user, etc.
Winter bash can be fun and users will sometimes get hats just by participating normally. Any user can opt-out of the Winter Bash (once it starts, any user can click a link like ""no hats for me, thanks""); no hats will be earned nor viewed.
Once Winter Bash 2015 begins (14 December), stats can be viewed at http://winterbash2015.stackexchange.com/ .

From Meta.SE, on encouraging or rushing people to accept answers
From Meta.Math, on people who don't accept answers
From Meta.SE, a very basic newcomer's primer on the effects in general of accepting an answer.

Extremes on both ends (immediately accepting first response, or never accepting a response) probably have impacts. I am guilty of ""not accepting"" sometimes, though I am usually good about up-voting any/all answers to a question of mine that have value. 
Accepting is the right thing to do if you have received an answer that answers your question. It gives you some extra points, the answer-er some extra points, and it helps draw other people to the answer that you (the asker) found most helpful.
Other considerations: 

You can always change your mind! If a new answer comes in that better answers your question, you can accept a different answer.
Questions without an accepted answer will show up in the ""unanswered questions"" list, even those that have (one or more) answers. I wish there were another list of ""questions that don't have any answers"" to them.

1183,1181,2,2016-02-15T04:41:38.917,,"In my humble, completely unbiased opinion, accepting one answer deters future answers to some extent. 
Generally speaking, as I scroll through the questions I skip over most of the ones with an accepted answer unless they have specific appeal to me. (To be honest, sometimes I skip over questions with unaccepted answers too.) However, in some cases the first answer is obviously inadequate, or as the case is with this one, I see that the question could have many more than one good answer. 
I find myself avoiding answered questions primarily due to the notion that I'll offend someone with my response by insinuating the incompleteness or inaccuracy of his answer. Therefore, the wording of the question itself and it's apparent openness to conflicting or slightly differing viewpoints will probably impact future responses more than actually accepting an answer.
This is an excellent question, and I'm always glad to see someone ask something that I've been thinking about so I don't have to.

What are the different types of coffee beans, and what are there characteristics? What other factors contribute to differences between one bean and another?

This is ridiculously broad, as seen by some of the comments in answers:


There's a lot to your question; some of the topics have been covered in other questions.
Answer by hoc_age ♦


Disclaimer: OK, as hoc_age has edited this question, I would like to contribute to this new version. Still, this is quite a broad topic, in my opinion.
Answer by MT San


To break this down, the OP is asking the following questions, all grouped under one heading:


What are the different types of coffee beans?
What are the characteristics of these coffee beans? (× however many kinds of beans identified in the above question)
What are all the factors that contribute to differences between beans?


The first sub-question by itself would be also be ridiculously broad. In the answers to the question, different types of beans were categorised according to regional differences (such as African, Asia-Pacific, but could be broken down even more into individual countries), species and sub-species of coffee (such as Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, Bourbon, Typica, Maragogype), and preparation methods (such as washing, dry-processing).
The second sub-question isn't actually a single question, but many questions. For example, ""What are the characteristics of Arabica beans?"" would attract quite different answers to ""What are the characteristics of dry-processed beans?"" Even then, 'characteristics' would have to be defined: shape? flavour? texture? smell? shelf-life? caffeine content?
The third sub-question is also too broad, even if it was split into an individual question, because everything that happens to a coffee bean contributes to its differences: location, handling, sunlight availability, nutrients in the soil, water availability, picking, transportation, roasting method, length of roasting... the list goes on.
A key indicator of the question being too broad is that the current highest-voted answer doesn't even attempt to address all these points, ending with:

And a lot of other factors... :)

I've already flagged this for moderator review but nothing seems to have happened... yet.
So: what does the community think? Should this question be closed as 'too broad'?
"
1199,1198,2,2016-05-25T13:10:01.113,,"I would say it is too broad, and should be closed.
I believe this topic is broad enough to be, at minimum, split into the following questions:

What bean-growth variables affect brewed coffee flavour and how?
What are the brewed flavour differences between species of coffee beans?
What bean-storage variables affect brewed coffee flavour and how?

And it can probably be split further than that.
Having the question be this broad risks a large number of answers with little commonality and certainly reduces the chances of a canonical answer within a reasonable word count.

coffee-machines: This sounds like an automated machine used to brew coffee.
equipment: This sounds like a manual equipment used while preparing coffee.

If it sounds, I opt to include such text as tag guidance.
In this case, ""a manual equipment to brew coffee"" is missing, maybe it can be added as a separate tag.
Another solution may be to add a tag synonym and tag everything as an equipment.

1203,1202,2,2016-10-01T20:34:02.340,,"The tags equipment and coffee-machines are certainly different enough to remain separate. By counter-example, I would consider an espresso tamper and a grinder as ""equipment"" but I couldn't consider tagging as ""coffee-machine"". Both could in a sense be considered as ""machines"", and they are for ""coffee"", I wouldn't consider either a ""coffee-machine"" as such.
Perhaps the equipment tag is too broad, but I think it's okay as a catch-all. It can include anything that is in coffee-machines, plus lots more. As was pointed out in question and comments, there are other coffee preparation equipment that aren't ""machines"", but there are already more specific tags for many, such as french-press, moka, and pour-over. There are also more general tags like drip-brew that isn't specific to machine or manual.

For those who are new to the Stack Exchange network, Winter Bash is an annual light-hearted event where users can earn virtual hats by doing certain things on an SE site within the Winter Bash time frame -- these hats that you earn can be worn as adornments on your SE avatar either on a particular site (e.g., Coffee) or network-wide (i.e., all of Stack Exchange).
The conditions for earning certain hats are ""public"" -- well-known to all; other hats are ""secret"" -- you need to figure out what to do to earn the hat. Some public hats might be... ask a well-received question, improve a question, submit an accepted edit, perform tasks in the review queue, etc. Some non-public hats in the past have been... contribute on a particular day, upvote and comment/improve on a first-question from a new user, etc.
Winter bash can be fun and users will sometimes get hats just by participating normally. Any user can opt-out of the Winter Bash (once it starts, any user can click a link like ""no hats for me, thanks""); no hats will be earned nor viewed.
Once Winter Bash begins (19 December), stats can be viewed at http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com/.
As a community, we can opt-out of Winterbash, but we are opted in by default. So, hats: yea or nay?

¹ ""Community"" here refers both to the membership of Coffee without diamonds next to their names, and to the automated systems otherwise known as user #-1.
² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.
³ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 3 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 3, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.
⁴ Includes close flags (but not close or reopen votes).
⁵ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.
⁶ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).

1230,,1,2020-01-01T16:48:36.640,2019: a year in moderation,"It's New Year's Day in Stack Exchange land...
A distinguishing characteristic of these sites is how they are moderated:

We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.
  -- A Theory of Moderation

While there certainly are Moderators here, a significant amount of the moderation is done by ordinary people, using the privileges 
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.
As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together. 
And what could be more festive than a big pile of numbers? 
So here is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on Coffee over the past 12 months:

² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.
³ A ""destroyed"" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.
⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.

1231,,1,2020-01-05T17:47:43.603,Can we ban low-quality product comparison websites?,"Us coffee nerds are forever searching for the best grinder / espresso machine / French press / other gadget for our passion. So asking for recommendations is for many users a logical approach.

We don’t accept blank “what is the best X” questions and close them ans opinion-based. 
When  a questioner gives a clear set of criteria (a grinder that’s quiet enough for a cubicle, bean-to cup machines that can handle two types of coffee), we will allow them, accepting that answers listing a certain model may be outdated at some point.

But:
Some of these questions attract answers that follow the pattern “Get a [product name], it’s the best on [some website that compares five models and looks pretty spammy otherwise].” - no why, no description of the critical features, not even a personal experience.
I know there are some very good blogs etc., whose authors really have a lot of knowledge and dedicate time and effort into reviewing their gadgets, so linking to them can actually support a recommendation. But some are blatantly advertising garnished with some wishy-washy text.
I therefore suggest:

Questions asking for product recommendations must list the intended use case and the critical feature(s), the more details the better.
Answers must 

Either be based on personal experience (the poster has used or at least tried out the mentioned product) and explain why the recommended product fulfills the asker’s needs, optionally, also explain any drawbacks.
Or support the recommendation with a source that primarily focuses on the products over advertising and post reviews that are qualified, detailed and based on good criteria. The site should show general knowledge and passion for the topic (ideally for making coffee, for some products, cooking or similar can also be good) and must label affiliate links clearly.


Answers that just link to some questionable site (“The ten best XYZ of 2020 - buy here” should be considered spam and treated accordingly.
"
1232,1231,2,2020-01-20T20:33:25.627,,"Oh! This is a duplicate. :)
Should we remove recommendation tag?
Actually, we have thought that it could be better to leave them open for a while, previously. Do you think that we should reconsider blocking them? I still think we are more or less in the same situation. Maybe, we could observe some more.

1233,,1,2020-01-24T07:18:44.793,What's the convention on coffee regarding signatures in questions and answers?,"The convention on StackExchange is that signatures in Q & A aren't required, or desired:

We don't want to clutter up question pages with a lot of redundant signature blocks and taglines and so forth. While these are common on forums, questions and answers on Stack Exchange should contain only relevant content.
Please use your built in profile, avatar, and username as your signature; that's what they are there for, and every post you make is already ""signed"" this way!

I recently proposed an edit to an answer which corrected a spelling mistake and removed the posters signature. This was approved by one user and then rejected by the author of the answer with the (canned) reason:

This edit does not make the post even a little bit easier to read, easier to find, more accurate or more accessible. Changes are either completely superfluous or actively harm readability.

Putting aside the fact that it's a wildly inappropriate reason to select when rejecting the specific edits made, what is the convention/policy on coffee regarding having / removing signatures from Q&A? Is there one that differs from SE as a whole, or does the convention stand?
"
1234,1233,2,2020-01-24T17:38:53.693,,"I see no reason why a different rule should apply. 
And when you are fixing a typo, removing greetings and signatures is common sense. It’s a minor edit, some may think it superfluous, I appreciate the effort.
If I am to venture a guess - the user in question has been a member for a comparatively  short time and no linked profiles to other sites. There’s a good chance that he simply didn’t know about the convention and combined with the fact that it takes some users a while to become comfortable with the fact that their posts may be edited by the community, the decline may well have been a knee-jerk protective reaction.

1237,,1,2020-06-03T08:54:22.113,Do we accept or close recipe requests?,"Seasoned Advice has excluded recipe requests for various reasons. One of the most important one being that asking for recipes is fundamentally opinion-based and therefore not a good fit for the site and the SE system in general.
Should we adapt this reasoning and rule for Coffee SE as well?
"
1238,1237,2,2020-06-05T04:50:17.800,,"I appreciate the Seasoned Advice stance and think we should use the same basic policy here for questions about ""how to make..."" something: reject the opinion-based ""what's the best recipe for..."" type of question but encourage questions relating more to technique or ingredient-list. As with SA there's a little bit of interpretation or leeway in that policy, and I think we'll have to do the same here.
The inspirational example linked in comment above could be interpreted as ""recreating"" or ""substitution"" -- the question I think could be steered toward ""what ingredients could I use to make it taste like that"" and be a helpful and productive question. In fact, I might comment on that question to steer it that way. More generally I would (personally) support or encourage edits or comments to steer questions along the lines of the Seasoned Advice policy.
Fortunately I think the space of ""recipe requests"" will be less problematic in Coffee by nature than in Seasoned Advice. That said, we should be vigilant about opinion-oriented pitfalls of brands or ingredients based on personal taste or preference.
