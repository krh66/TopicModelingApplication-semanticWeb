If the environment is mac, all you need to do is run the Interface Unit executable file inside Interface folder. An user interface will pop out. The process will take several minutes. </br>
<br/>
For windows: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19hVGInGWe2pWxXsovdVLgwy2-ePZl4wH/view?usp=sharing<br/>
If the environment is windows, all you need to do is run the .exe file and you will get a running application. This process will take several minutes. <br/>

We place all the original files about data we got from the website in the data folder.
