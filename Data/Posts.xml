The only reason seems to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/97371/262760&quot;&gt;that it isn't necessary&lt;/a&gt; and/or it's harmful to add another queue for mods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The help section says that &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/help/editing&quot;&gt;any user should be able to suggest edits&lt;/a&gt;, which is true on the [main] site.  But because there's no suggested-edit queue it seems that the edit ability on [meta] only for higher-rep users (1000+; 2000+ on &quot;mature&quot; sites), which is the trusted-user rep threshold at which point you can make edits directly (without going into a suggestion-queue). I suppose this means that at 1k rep you can also edit meta directly, but it's a little awkward to suggest stuff that ought to be changed &quot;out of band&quot;.

I suggested an edit that might clarify what you're trying to express without changing the intent of your post&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The person can then just review the edit, and apply it or change it slightly if they agree. On meta, where it's &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more about voice, that's pretty ideal. Unfortunately the way you've proposed it is just not technically feasible. I'll go into why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The voices, man, I keep hearing 'em!&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every suggested edit generates an inbox notification. On sites like Ask Ubuntu, Ask Different, Stack Overflow and others where meta sees significantly more participation than other sites, this would create &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of noise. The alternative is not generating inbox notifications for child meta suggested edits, which (unfortunately, for the most part) means they'd go unseen or approved in a queue by others, and &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; not be something the author would have approved as suggested. Meta is a town hall; that's why you need privileges to edit directly on the main site to edit here, one of the chief reasons anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Killed by slow, and do you even meta?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On sites that &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; have very active child meta sites, participation is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; lower. Turning on work queues here would just mean creating a backlog that moderators would feel obliged to clean out from time to time. It just wouldn't work as you intend it to work. Showing them in the &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; site queue alleviates that to some extent, but that's shown to everyone regardless of meta participation. Queues where you accomplish small units of work are already a big ask on the main site, I really don't want to mix them.

Keep in mind that the welcome isn't for us, it's for the new user. Even if the same welcome message has been posted plenty of times and you're tired of it, it's the first time &lt;em&gt;they've&lt;/em&gt; seen it - that's why they're being welcomed! So it doesn't seem nearly so robotic to them as to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, while making them feel welcomed is half the goal, letting them know about the ground rules is really important too. A lot of people expect discussion forums, and are really confused by the way StackExchange sites work the first time they visit. They post not-really-answers, they take downvotes personally, and so on. Pointing them to the tour/help at the first opportunity is an attempt to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in my mind, the canned messages are fine. I might tweak the one you quoted a bit, but there's nothing wrong with something along those lines. If I wanted to go beyond that, I'd simply to throw in a specific comment as well - something very simple that I liked about their post, or a suggestion for improving it. But that's not always too easy, and I don't think there's anything wrong with just using the template.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, if you want more variety, why not just welcome them yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The moderators don't own the site. Their primary job is to do the things that no one else can. This early in a beta, there's a little more in that category since there are fewer high-reputation users. But welcoming a new user? All you need to be able to do is comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to contribute some variety, go for it. A variety of &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; doing the welcoming is perhaps even more meaningful than a variety of messages: it demonstrates that the site is a community site, not one kept carefully under the control of a few moderators.

What do you think? I'd be happy to re-articulate the question with you, or un-lock it if you change it around.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Kopi Luwak taste like?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;I have never had the opportunity to try Kopi Luwak, but I'd like to know how it tastes.

That said, I saw some confusion (partly my own) about a topic, so I wrote a self-Q/A about &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean&quot;&gt;What do the terms extraction and strength mean?&lt;/a&gt; My goal there was to clear up some terms that I didn't understand and that were being used somewhat inconsistently or imprecisely.

For example, if I search for how to make a cup of coffee in an auto-drip coffeemaker, I think I'd find a very large number of answers that are very adequate... therefore, they don't need to be &quot;asked&quot; here as such. That said, I'd be totally happy if someone earnestly asked something like that and got an earnest, helpful answer from this community.

But the question is about using coffee in a recipe, i.e. in the context of cooking. You're asking about one ingredient as part of a whole, about the combination of non-coffee flavors with other ingredients. People who are experts in making coffee are not necessarily experts in all of that, but people who are experts in cooking will know about how to use all kinds of ingredients, including coffee. It seems like a question that, despite your initial guess, is more about cooking than it is about coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I'm not sure exactly how you'd shape it up to make it more clearly seek coffee expertise. Coffee expertise will get you great answers about how much the flavor of different kinds of coffee differs, but not much about how obvious that'll be in the context of a tiramisu recipe. What were you trying to ask that cooking folks can't tell you?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I'm not sure I'd make it a goal to keep it on coffee; it's not like it suffered because of the migration. When you're asking a question, the goal isn't to make sure it's on a particular site, it's just to get the best answers possible. I missed this when it showed up on cooking, but I think most likely the reason this didn't get any answers beyond the one that was migrated with it is that it's a pretty general question with a general answer, so it's hard to really give a more specific expert answer.  (If it &lt;em&gt;hadn't&lt;/em&gt; had that answer, you would doubtless have quickly gotten an answer on cooking, and been just as satisfied.)

The polls may well work out for some amount of time right now - as you say, the site's smaller. But in the long run I'd predict you'll find yourself gradually changing your mind and starting to close them. Old polls still attract new answers. Old polls get used as examples to justify new broad/subjective questions. And new ones get less and less manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Math.SE probably isn't really a great example in favor of this idea; if you look through their big-list tag, you'll find plenty where the voting/sorting has broken down because there are just too many answers, and the early popular ones win out.

From what I can tell, the ones that are working out are the ones that aren't actually terribly big lists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So... it's certainly something you can do, and it's possible it'd attract some users.

Maybe that's a tradeoff worth making, but it's also not a bad idea to try to find other ways to broaden your scope that aren't polls.

In the answers to the question, different types of beans were categorised according to &lt;strong&gt;regional differences&lt;/strong&gt; (such as African, Asia-Pacific, but could be broken down even more into individual countries), &lt;strong&gt;species and sub-species of coffee&lt;/strong&gt; (such as Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, Bourbon, Typica, Maragogype), and &lt;strong&gt;preparation methods&lt;/strong&gt; (such as washing, dry-processing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second sub-question isn't actually a single question, but many questions. For example, &quot;What are the characteristics of Arabica beans?&quot; would attract quite different answers to &quot;What are the characteristics of dry-processed beans?&quot; Even then, 'characteristics' would have to be defined: shape? flavour? texture? smell? shelf-life? caffeine content?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The third sub-question is also too broad, even if it was split into an individual question, because everything that happens to a coffee bean contributes to its differences: location, handling, sunlight availability, nutrients in the soil, water availability, picking, transportation, roasting method, length of roasting... the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A key indicator of the question being too broad is that the current highest-voted answer doesn't even attempt to address all these points, ending with:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And a lot of other factors... :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've already flagged this for moderator review but nothing seems to have happened... yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So: what does the community think?

So asking for recommendations is for many users a logical approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We don’t accept blank “what is the best X” questions and close them ans opinion-based. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When  a questioner gives a clear set of criteria (&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/48/which-type-of-coffee-grinder-is-the-quietest&quot;&gt;a grinder that’s quiet enough for a cubicle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3813/what-bean-to-cup-machines-are-available-with-dual-hopper-system-to-allow-regular&quot;&gt;bean-to cup machines that can handle two types of coffee&lt;/a&gt;), we will allow them, accepting that answers listing a certain model may be outdated at some point.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of these questions attract answers that follow the pattern “Get a [product name], it’s the best on [some website that compares five models and looks pretty spammy otherwise].” - no why, no description of the critical features, not even a personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know there are some very good blogs etc., whose authors really have a lot of knowledge and dedicate time and effort into reviewing their gadgets, so linking to them can actually support a recommendation.

The site should show general knowledge and passion for the topic (ideally for making coffee, for some products, cooking or similar can also be good) and must label affiliate links clearly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answers that just link to some questionable site (“The ten best XYZ of 2020 - buy here” should be considered spam and treated accordingly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1118" LastActivityDate="2020-01-20T20:33:25.627" Title="Can we ban low-quality product comparison websites?"
