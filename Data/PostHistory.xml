Look carefully.&#xD;&#xA; - Are many of their answers that also mention their product only _tangentially_ related to the question at hand? That can spell trouble, if someone is looking for places to plant stuff&#xD;&#xA; - Do they clearly mention that it's their link? That's important, as it asserts a sort of &quot;I hereby assert that this is given in good faith in the spirit of being helpful&quot; thing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We positively _want_ people whose job is coffee on this site, those are your professionals, the people that do lots of science and can answer tougher questions, especially about the brewing process. If they support some of their answers with stuff they're affiliated with, that's great. If they go a bit too overboard, moderators have means of contacting them to let them know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***With that said...***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Coffee is a topic that is _ripe_ with products (no pun intended), and we will see our fair share of folks that have come here for the wrong reasons. Fortunately, most of us have a very good ability to determine when something just _doesn't seem right_ - and we give you the ability to flag things for moderator attention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you see something that gives you a bit of pause, and you _seriously_ wonder if the person is here for the wrong reasons, flag it as 'other' and let us / the moderators-to-be have a look at it. _Blatant_ spam obviously deserves a spam flag directly, I'm talking about the &quot;If it weren't for the other answers in their history linking to the same site, this would seem completely benign&quot; sorts of things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our job as hosts is to make people feel welcome and do our best to basically get out of their way as they participate. The fewer rules, the better. If this becomes a major problem down the road we can revisit it, but for now, I think it's sufficient if folks just keep an eye out for anything (or, to the point, anyone) going sideways with it."

I suggested an edit that might clarify what you're trying to express without changing the intent of your post&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The person can then just review the edit, and apply it or change it slightly if they agree. On meta, where it's _much_ more about voice, that's pretty ideal. Unfortunately the way you've proposed it is just not technically feasible. I'll go into why.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###The voices, man, I keep hearing 'em!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Every suggested edit generates an inbox notification. On sites like Ask Ubuntu, Ask Different, Stack Overflow and others where meta sees significantly more participation than other sites, this would create _a lot_ of noise. The alternative is not generating inbox notifications for child meta suggested edits, which (unfortunately, for the most part) means they'd go unseen or approved in a queue by others, and _might_ not be something the author would have approved as suggested. Meta is a town hall; that's why you need privileges to edit directly on the main site to edit here, one of the chief reasons anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Killed by slow, and do you even meta?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On sites that _don't_ have very active child meta sites, participation is _much_ lower. Turning on work queues here would just mean creating a backlog that moderators would feel obliged to clean out from time to time. It just wouldn't work as you intend it to work. Showing them in the _main_ site queue alleviates that to some extent, but that's shown to everyone regardless of meta participation. Queues where you accomplish small units of work are already a big ask on the main site, I really don't want to mix them. As meta sites tend to take on their own culture over time, I don't want non-participants here reviewing suggested edits because the system asked them to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###I am a mean, horrible person.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But with all of that said, turning our engine sort of upside down for discussion here on meta worked well enough. But, it's missing stuff. There aren't any polls, people can get down-voted for asking for support, curating is sort of second class and opportunistic and using it as a bug tracker could be made much more ideal. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I _hope_ to take on a project this year that takes a serious look at child meta sites, and how they could perhaps diverge a bit in terms of features from the main sites. This is something I'd like to see possible, just ... better, not bolted on. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm declining it as proposed, but that doesn't make it a bad idea.

Text="An adjunct to @fredley's answer: You can ask questions ***associated with coffee.***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The tour](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/tour) sums it in the first sentence:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Coffee Stack Exchange** is a question and answer site for people interested in all aspects of producing and consuming coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's it.  If your question doesn't involve producing or consuming coffee, it's questionable.  Though coffee (does, generally) happen to contain caffeine, caffeine (itself) is *not* the topic of the site. Some other examples: Cola is off-topic, even though the beverage has a similar color. [Tea is off-topic](http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/q/91/262) (see also [original discussion](http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/q/12394/120719)), even though it has other similarities. Questions that discuss coffee, and happen to mention other topics (e.g., tea or cola) are fine -- *if they discuss coffee* as their primary topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, we *do* need to put some content at the [help/on-topic page](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic).

Keep in mind that the welcome isn't for us, it's for the new user. Even if the same welcome message has been posted plenty of times and you're tired of it, it's the first time *they've* seen it - that's why they're being welcomed! So it doesn't seem nearly so robotic to them as to you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, while making them feel welcomed is half the goal, letting them know about the ground rules is really important too. A lot of people expect discussion forums, and are really confused by the way StackExchange sites work the first time they visit. They post not-really-answers, they take downvotes personally, and so on. Pointing them to the tour/help at the first opportunity is an attempt to avoid this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in my mind, the canned messages are fine. I might tweak the one you quoted a bit, but there's nothing wrong with something along those lines. If I wanted to go beyond that, I'd simply to throw in a specific comment as well - something very simple that I liked about their post, or a suggestion for improving it. But that's not always too easy, and I don't think there's anything wrong with just using the template.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, if you want more variety, why not just welcome them yourself?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The moderators don't own the site. Their primary job is to do the things that no one else can. This early in a beta, there's a little more in that category since there are fewer high-reputation users. But welcoming a new user? All you need to be able to do is comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you want to contribute some variety, go for it. A variety of *users* doing the welcoming is perhaps even more meaningful than a variety of messages: it demonstrates that the site is a community site, not one kept carefully under the control of a few moderators. Just keep in mind *why* you're doing it: to make them feel welcome, yes, but also to help them learn how the site works so they can make good contributions." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

What do you think? I'd be happy to re-articulate the question with you, or un-lock it if you change it around.  For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;**What does Kopi Luwak taste like?**&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;I have never had the opportunity to try Kopi Luwak, but I'd like to know how it tastes. How is does the taste differ from more traditionally processed coffee from the same region? Are there other coffees that have similar tasting notes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;Or something like that. That said, [this answer says Kopi Luwak is delicious](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/141/262), and has some descriptions, but there's probably room for another question on the topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Another question might be something more like &quot;*Why* does Kopi Luwak taste different?&quot; For example, what is it about the Kopi Luwak digestion process that changes the beans? What happens to the beans during digestion (e.g., protein digestion)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There might also be room for a question about [Black Ivory Coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Ivory_coffee), which is apparently coffee digestively &quot;processed&quot; in a similar way by rescued elephants."

The questions we have already have on brewing methods etc are great, but take a look at any other **successful** coffee site and you'll see 9/10 times they're split into sub sections on machine manufacturer as well as different brewing methods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, we can't just lump all 'espresso' questions together and discourage questions which want to know the specifics on one machine/brand. An entry level £50 espresso machine is a whole different ball game to one costing £1000+, and believe me people who are into their coffee will drop that kind of money easily, and will want answers on their specific set up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is just my opinion, but I have been put off asking questions I've had because they're very much related to my machine and grinder set up.

I especially liked [this answer from hardmath](http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1131/262) about how [Math.SE](http://math.stackexchange.com) handles some of those &quot;canonical&quot; topics.(Aside: [His particular example](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/39802/why-does-123-cdots-frac112) is fasinating and blew my mind. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think there's value in letting good answers to such topics &quot;happen organically,&quot; even though that's somewhat less satisfying in certain ways than getting some good, fundamental answer to some good, fundamental question committed into the annals of the Internet(s). That said, I saw some confusion (partly my own) about a topic, so I wrote a self-Q/A about http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean My goal there was to clear up some terms that I didn't understand and that were being used somewhat inconsistently or imprecisely. Especially in those cases, I'm certainly in favor of penning a good Q/A.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, I think having some &quot;softball&quot; questions every once in a while, even if duplicate, is healthy. If a new user to the site gets hooked by giving a solid answer to a question, that's a great &quot;gateway&quot; to this community. Having fundamental topics that are &quot;still open&quot; might be a good hook for a new user.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another take on this is that some questions that are on-topic for the site might be already answered well other places. For example, if I search for how to make a cup of coffee in an auto-drip coffeemaker, I think I'd find a very large number of answers that are very adequate... therefore, they don't need to be &quot;asked&quot; here as such. That said, I'd be totally happy if someone earnestly asked something like that and got an earnest, helpful answer from this community.

It was posted and had ***zero votes, zero answers, and zero other comments*** when I suggested that it get migrated over to here at Coffee. I got push-back from my comments and ended up chatting with her (SA mod) in Chat. Her perspective was very by-the-book (i.e., the aforementioned meta) that says &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;    We only migrate questions because they are off-topic on the original site. It is perfectly possible for a question to be on-topic on multiple sites, but that is not a reason to migrate it elsewhere. ***As a general rule***, if someone asks a question here, and it's on-topic here, it should stay here.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(My emphasis added).

I disagree *in this particular case*, but she's a mod there and I'll respect her adherence to policy and conviction!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, migration should be &quot;uncommon&quot;. To OP's point, I think the question in question should remain here. The Coffeemaker question, I think, should have been migrated here. This may sound relativist, but we're young and can use on-point questions such as that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My opinion: If you, as an OP...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* are posting a question that is on-topic at multiple sites, and&#xD;&#xA;* are aware of both sites, and &#xD;&#xA;* choose to post it at site A instead of other sites (as @starsplusplus did in this case),&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;then I maintain that *it should not be migrated*.

Not all of those sites are graduated, so you won't necessarily be able to place community promotion ads, but it might be a place to start if some Coffee SE ambassadors try to make new friends in those chat rooms and see if they've got any coffee questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The upshot of this type of activity is that you aren't trying to take existing people or questions from a site that already welcomes them; you're just trying to show people who might be interested in coffee tinkering that there's a place where their questions would be welcome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My advice, in the general, tl;dr sense, would be to think about what other types of people would be likely to hang out and ask questions here (the hard part), and then figure out where to go to reach those people (the easy part).

The polls may well work out for some amount of time right now - as you say, the site's smaller. But in the long run I'd predict you'll find yourself gradually changing your mind and starting to close them. Old polls still attract new answers. Old polls get used as examples to justify new broad/subjective questions. And new ones get less and less manageable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Math.SE probably isn't really a great example in favor of this idea; if you look through their big-list tag, you'll find plenty where the voting/sorting has broken down because there are just too many answers, and the early popular ones win out. You'll also find a decent number that are on hold/closed. From what I can tell, the ones that are working out are the ones that aren't actually terribly big lists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So... it's certainly something you can do, and it's possible it'd attract some users. But if the site keeps growing, you'll almost inevitably find that you have to do a good amount of work to revise your policies and clean up later. Maybe that's a tradeoff worth making, but it's also not a bad idea to try to find other ways to broaden your scope that aren't polls.

Questions about coffee equipment and questions about cleaning are certainly on-topic, so it's totally reasonable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See also, for example, questions tagged [equipment](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/equipment) and especially this one about [descaling espresso machines](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/242/how-does-one-descale-an-espresso-machine-and-how-often-to-do-it) but your question is certainly different enough to warrant asking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope it's well-received. Some thoughts just for completeness:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Necessary to mention your old machine? Just say you have some other leftover Gaggia brand descaler.&#xD;&#xA;* Do you know the ingredients list of either descaler?&#xD;&#xA;* Is your question simply &quot;can I use the Gaggia stuff in the Sage machine?&quot; Just another way to ask a similar question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope the answer is &quot;descalers are descalers&quot; but analogs like &quot;can I use off-brand ink in this inkjet printer&quot; hopefully don't hold here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Welcome to Coffee.SE!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Are we in??&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For those who are new to the Stack Exchange network, Winter Bash is an annual light-hearted event where users can earn virtual &quot;hats&quot; by doing certain things on an SE site within the Winter Bash time frame -- these virtual &quot;hats&quot; that you earn can be &quot;worn&quot; as adornments on your SE avatar either on a particular site (e.g., Coffee) or network-wide (i.e., all of Stack Exchange).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The conditions for earning certain hats are &quot;public&quot; -- well-known to all; other hats are &quot;secret&quot; -- you need to figure out what to do to earn the hat. Some public hats might be... ask a well-received question, improve a question, submit an accepted edit, perform tasks in the review queue, etc. Some non-public hats in the past have been... contribute on a particular day, upvote and comment/improve on a first-question from a new user, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Winter bash can be fun and users will sometimes get hats just by participating normally. Any user can opt-out of the Winter Bash (once it starts, any user can click a link like &quot;no hats for me, thanks&quot;); no hats will be earned nor viewed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once Winter Bash 2015 begins (14 December), stats can be viewed at http://winterbash2015.stackexchange.com/ .

In sum: if you got an answer that fully or sufficiently answers your question, accept it.

If there's nothing qualitatively missing, then I think you've got your answer. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I looked around on Meta to see if this question has been asked before, and I didn't immediately find one. Here's a few with related topics:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [From Meta.SE, on encouraging or rushing people to accept answers](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/191755/can-we-stop-rushing-people-to-accept-an-answer)&#xD;&#xA;* [From Meta.Math, on people who don't accept answers](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/13286/people-who-do-not-accept-answers-suggestion-for-dealing-with-this)&#xD;&#xA;* [From Meta.SE, a very basic newcomer's primer on the effects in general of accepting an answer](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Extremes on both ends (immediately accepting first response, or never accepting a response) probably have impacts. I am guilty of &quot;not accepting&quot; sometimes, though I am usually good about up-voting any/all answers to a question of mine that have value. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Accepting is the right thing to do if you have received an answer that answers your question. It gives you some extra points, the answer-er some extra points, and it helps draw other people to the answer that you (the asker) found most helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other considerations: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **You can always change your mind!** If a new answer comes in that better answers your question, you can accept a different answer.&#xD;&#xA;* Questions without an ***accepted*** answer will show up in **the &quot;unanswered questions&quot; list**, even those that have (one or more) answers.

(× however many kinds of beans identified in the above question)&#xD;&#xA;- What are all the factors that contribute to differences between beans?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first sub-question by itself would be also be ridiculously broad. In the answers to the question, different types of beans were categorised according to **regional differences** (such as African, Asia-Pacific, but could be broken down even more into individual countries), **species and sub-species of coffee** (such as Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, Bourbon, Typica, Maragogype), and **preparation methods** (such as washing, dry-processing).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second sub-question isn't actually a single question, but many questions. For example, &quot;What are the characteristics of Arabica beans?&quot; would attract quite different answers to &quot;What are the characteristics of dry-processed beans?&quot; Even then, 'characteristics' would have to be defined: shape? flavour? texture? smell? shelf-life? caffeine content?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The third sub-question is also too broad, even if it was split into an individual question, because everything that happens to a coffee bean contributes to its differences: location, handling, sunlight availability, nutrients in the soil, water availability, picking, transportation, roasting method, length of roasting... the list goes on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A key indicator of the question being too broad is that the current highest-voted answer doesn't even attempt to address all these points, ending with:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And a lot of other factors... :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've already flagged this for moderator review but nothing seems to have happened... yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: what does the community think?

Millions of people drink coffee, but what we're looking for here is coffee *hobbyists*, not just drinkers. People who like to experiment with brewing methods, spend money on gear, and optimize for various qualities. They aren't just coffee drinkers - they're coffee *tinkerers*. So people who might be drawn to this site are tinkerers in other fields who dabble in coffee (among many other likely hobbies). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some initial thoughts about where these kinds of people might come from:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Bicycles&#xD;&#xA;* Beer&#xD;&#xA;* Homebrewing&#xD;&#xA;* Lifehacks&#xD;&#xA;* The Great Outdoors&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are probably way more. Not all of those sites are graduated, so you won't necessarily be able to place community promotion ads, but it might be a place to start if some Coffee SE ambassadors try to make new friends in those chat rooms and see if they've got any coffee questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The upshot of this type of activity is that you aren't trying to take existing people or questions from a site that already welcomes them; you're just trying to show people who might be interested in coffee tinkering that there's a place where their questions would be welcome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My advice, in the general, tl;dr sense, would be to think about what other types of people would be likely to hang out and ask questions here (the hard part), and then figure out where to go to reach those people (the easy part).

Having fundamental topics that are &quot;still open&quot; might be a good hook for a new user.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another take on this is that some questions that are on-topic for the site might be already answered well other places. For example, if I search for how to make a cup of coffee in an auto-drip coffeemaker, I think I'd find a very large number of answers that are very adequate... therefore, they don't need to be &quot;asked&quot; here as such.

What do you think? I'd be happy to re-articulate the question with you, or un-lock it if you change it around.  For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;**What does Kopi Luwak taste like?**&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;I have never had the opportunity to try Kopi Luwak, but I'd like to know how it tastes. How is does the taste differ from more traditionally processed coffee from the same region? Are there other coffees that have similar tasting notes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;Or something like that. That said, [this answer says Kopi Luwak is delicious](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/141/262), and has some descriptions, but there's probably room for another question on the topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Another question might be something more like &quot;*Why* does Kopi Luwak taste different?&quot; For example, what is it about the Kopi Luwak digestion process that changes the beans? What happens to the beans during digestion (e.g., protein digestion)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There might also be room for a question about [Black Ivory Coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Ivory_coffee), which is apparently coffee digestively &quot;processed&quot; in a similar way by rescued elephants."

What do you think? I'd be happy to re-articulate the question with you, or un-lock it if you change it around.  For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;**What does Kopi Luwak taste like?**&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;I have never had the opportunity to try Kopi Luwak, but I'd like to know how it tastes. How is does the taste differ from more traditionally processed coffee from the same region? Are there other coffees that have similar tasting notes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;Or something like that. That said, [this answer says Kopi Luwak is delicious](https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/141/262), and has some descriptions, but there's probably room for another question on the topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Another question might be something more like &quot;*Why* does Kopi Luwak taste different?&quot; For example, what is it about the Kopi Luwak digestion process that changes the beans? What happens to the beans during digestion (e.g., protein digestion)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There might also be room for a question about [Black Ivory Coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Ivory_coffee), which is apparently coffee digestively &quot;processed&quot; in a similar way by rescued elephants."

Just say you have some other leftover Gaggia brand descaler.&#xD;&#xA;* Do you know the ingredients list of either descaler?&#xD;&#xA;* Is your question simply &quot;can I use the Gaggia stuff in the Sage machine?&quot; Just another way to ask a similar question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope the answer is &quot;descalers are descalers&quot; but analogs like &quot;can I use off-brand ink in this inkjet printer&quot; hopefully don't hold here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Welcome to Coffee.SE!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Still, this is quite a broad topic, in my opinion.*  &#xD;&#xA;[Answer][3] by [MT San][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To break this down, the OP is asking the following questions, all grouped under one heading:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - What are the different types of coffee beans?&#xD;&#xA;- What are the characteristics of these coffee beans? (× however many kinds of beans identified in the above question)&#xD;&#xA;- What are all the factors that contribute to differences between beans?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first sub-question by itself would be also be ridiculously broad. In the answers to the question, different types of beans were categorised according to **regional differences** (such as African, Asia-Pacific, but could be broken down even more into individual countries), **species and sub-species of coffee** (such as Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, Bourbon, Typica, Maragogype), and **preparation methods** (such as washing, dry-processing).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second sub-question isn't actually a single question, but many questions. For example, &quot;What are the characteristics of Arabica beans?&quot; would attract quite different answers to &quot;What are the characteristics of dry-processed beans?&quot; Even then, 'characteristics' would have to be defined: shape? flavour? texture? smell? shelf-life? caffeine content?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The third sub-question is also too broad, even if it was split into an individual question, because everything that happens to a coffee bean contributes to its differences: location, handling, sunlight availability, nutrients in the soil, water availability, picking, transportation, roasting method, length of roasting... the list goes on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A key indicator of the question being too broad is that the current highest-voted answer doesn't even attempt to address all these points, ending with:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And a lot of other factors... :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've already flagged this for moderator review but nothing seems to have happened... yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: what does the community think?

So asking for recommendations is for many users a logical approach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- We don’t accept blank “what is the best X” questions and close them ans opinion-based. &#xD;&#xA;- When  a questioner gives a clear set of criteria ([a grinder that’s quiet enough for a cubicle](https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/48/which-type-of-coffee-grinder-is-the-quietest), [bean-to cup machines that can handle two types of coffee](https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3813/what-bean-to-cup-machines-are-available-with-dual-hopper-system-to-allow-regular)), we will allow them, accepting that answers listing a certain model may be outdated at some point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_But:_&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of these questions attract answers that follow the pattern “Get a [product name], it’s the best on [some website that compares five models and looks pretty spammy otherwise].” - no why, no description of the critical features, not even a personal experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know there are some very good blogs etc., whose authors really have a lot of knowledge and dedicate time and effort into reviewing their gadgets, so linking to them can actually support a recommendation. But some are blatantly advertising garnished with some wishy-washy text.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I therefore suggest:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - _Questions_ asking for product recommendations must list the intended use case and the critical feature(s), the more details the better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - _Answers_ must &#xD;&#xA;- Either be based on personal experience (the poster has used or at least tried out the mentioned product) and explain why the recommended product fulfills the asker’s needs, optionally, also explain any drawbacks.&#xD;&#xA;- Or support the recommendation with a source that primarily focuses on the products over advertising and post reviews that are qualified, detailed and based on good criteria. The site should show general knowledge and passion for the topic (ideally for making coffee, for some products, cooking or similar can also be good) and must label affiliate links clearly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Answers that just link to some questionable site (“The ten best XYZ of 2020 - buy here” should be considered spam and treated accordingly.**" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The Stack Exchange has little interest in duplicating services other parts of the Internet are already good at providing, and is structured so that often those services just plain don't work here.

If a potential question hits more than one of the flags, that's a sign it's likely not gonna work out here.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, avoid asking subjective questions where …&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; - every answer is equally valid&#xA;&gt; - there is no actual problem to be solved&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; ([source](https://coffee.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask))&#xA;&#xA;A list of coffees would make every answer equally valid, and there's no actual problem being solved. That breaks our voting system, making it impossible for our answers to be neatly sorted by the groupmind.&#xA;&#xA;Now lets look at signs of a *good* question:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; - Have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your question?&#xA;&gt; - if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful answer.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; ([source](https://coffee.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask))&#xA;&#xA;The second bullet point there reinforces the idea that questions should have problems they're trying to solve: without a particular situation the querent faces, details and context for useful answers are impossible.&#xA;&#xA;And the first bullet point really hits the thing on the nose: the Stack is a place to ask experts to leverage their education and experience in a field to solve problems we can't solve ourselves. **The Stack is not a place to ask experts to do simple research for us.**&#xA;&#xA;For further reading, I suggest [Repositories](https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/q/997); [Polling, Recommendations and subjective-ish stuff](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/57383/244929); [Questions with educational value](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/117312/244929); [Is trivia on topic?](https://rpg.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4805/4398); and [What's so problematic about a recommendation question having potentially hundreds of answers, anyway?](https://rpg.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3398/4398).&#xA;&#xA;And, of course, there's always [Wikipedia's List of Coffee Drinks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coffee_drinks)."

I suggested an edit that might clarify what you're trying to express without changing the intent of your post&#xA;&#xA;The person can then just review the edit, and apply it or change it slightly if they agree. On meta, where it's _much_ more about voice, that's pretty ideal. Unfortunately the way you've proposed it is just not technically feasible. I'll go into why.&#xA;&#xA;### The voices, man, I keep hearing 'em!&#xA;&#xA;Every suggested edit generates an inbox notification. On sites like Ask Ubuntu, Ask Different, Stack Overflow and others where meta sees significantly more participation than other sites, this would create _a lot_ of noise. The alternative is not generating inbox notifications for child meta suggested edits, which (unfortunately, for the most part) means they'd go unseen or approved in a queue by others, and _might_ not be something the author would have approved as suggested. Meta is a town hall; that's why you need privileges to edit directly on the main site to edit here, one of the chief reasons anyway.&#xA;&#xA;### Killed by slow, and do you even meta?&#xA;&#xA;On sites that _don't_ have very active child meta sites, participation is _much_ lower. Turning on work queues here would just mean creating a backlog that moderators would feel obliged to clean out from time to time. It just wouldn't work as you intend it to work. Showing them in the _main_ site queue alleviates that to some extent, but that's shown to everyone regardless of meta participation. Queues where you accomplish small units of work are already a big ask on the main site, I really don't want to mix them. As meta sites tend to take on their own culture over time, I don't want non-participants here reviewing suggested edits because the system asked them to.&#xA;&#xA;### I am a mean, horrible person.&#xA;&#xA;But with all of that said, turning our engine sort of upside down for discussion here on meta worked well enough. But, it's missing stuff. There aren't any polls, people can get down-voted for asking for support, curating is sort of second class and opportunistic and using it as a bug tracker could be made much more ideal. &#xA;&#xA;I _hope_ to take on a project this year that takes a serious look at child meta sites, and how they could perhaps diverge a bit in terms of features from the main sites. This is something I'd like to see possible, just ... better, not bolted on. &#xA;&#xA;I'm declining it as proposed, but that doesn't make it a bad idea. In fact it's a good one (heck, I up-voted it), but in need of some groundwork that I _really_ want to do." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />
